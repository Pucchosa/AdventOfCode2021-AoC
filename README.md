beginner Advent of Code 2021 in Java
Hi, I'm learning Java so I decided to try to resolve (I know I'm late) the Advent of Code 2021.
So far I have 34* an I'm afraid thats it for me for now.
I'll clean up my code and put it here, if someone at my same java level can be interested, or if someone better than me wants to suggest some correction I'll be glad.
(I'm also learning how GitHub works...)
